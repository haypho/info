    <p>
      I would first like to thank you for viewing my portfolio! It does not look
      like much now, but the plan is to continue to add personal projects and
      coding challenges in the near future. People always say that time is
      valuable, but seasoned developers know that documentation is too! ðŸ˜‰
    </p>
    <strong>More coming soon!</strong>
