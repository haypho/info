            I wasn&apos;t always a TypeScript enthusiast. I actually didn&apos;t
            even get my start in web technologies. When I first started learning
            programming, I was learning Java. As I experienced different
            technologies, I learned that I really enjoyed Frontend Engineering.
            This is where the love for JavaScript began. However, I will always
            have a special place for Java.

          <p>
            My first experience with frontend frameworks was Angular. As I
            learned more about the frontend ecosystem, I started working with
            Vue and React as well. I now have 5+ years of experience working
            with React. I also managed to launch my own app using React Native
            (and Expo by association). With the large adoption of these
            frameworks, I imagine I will accumulate a few more years of
            experience with them ðŸ˜…
